# Using r2 to Uncover Mobile App Weaknesses (r2con2025)

2025-10-24

> In this talk we'll dice into common mobile app weaknesses from the OWASP MASWE catalogue and demonstrates how to uncover them in practice. Using radare2 and other essential tools from the OWASP MASTG, we will solve reverse engineering challenges and validate MASTG tests step by step. All challenges will be available as APK and IPA files for hands-on practice. Will we also use AI to tackle some of these challenges? Maybe.
