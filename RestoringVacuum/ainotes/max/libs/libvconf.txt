Short answer: libvconf is Tizen’s (and legacy Samsung platforms’) configuration/key–value service library. It’s part of the Tizen platform and the vconf project is available as open source in the Tizen repositories (vendor devices may add proprietary keys or extensions).

More detail you can use

- Purpose
  - Centralized key–value configuration API used by system components and apps to store/read system settings and preferences.
  - Provides typed values (bool/int/double/string) and notifications when keys change.

- Architecture
  - A client library (libvconf) plus a service/daemon/backing store that keeps current values and handles notifications.
  - Keys and default values are typically declared in XML schema files installed with packages; runtime values come from the vconf database/backend.

- Common API (C)
  - Header: #include <vconf.h>
  - Read:
    - vconf_get_bool(const char *key, int *value)
    - vconf_get_int(const char *key, int *value)
    - vconf_get_str(const char *key, char **value)  (caller frees)
  - Write:
    - vconf_set_bool(const char *key, int value)
    - vconf_set_int(const char *key, int value)
    - vconf_set_str(const char *key, const char *value)
  - Notifications:
    - vconf_notify_key_changed(const char *key, vconf_callback_fn cb, void *data)
    - vconf_ignore_key_changed(const char *key, vconf_callback_fn cb)
  - Lifecycle:
    - vconf_open() / vconf_close() (depending on version/build)
  - Error codes and types are provided in vconf.h.

- Typical key names and deployment
  - Keys are namespaced strings (e.g. "db/local/media/volume" or vendor-specific keys).
  - Default schemas live in system directories (packaged XML files). On devices these are under system config paths (distribution-dependent).

- Tools & inspection
  - Many platforms provide a command-line vconf tool or package utilities to query/set keys. If not, use a small C program that calls vconf_get_*.
  - To find the library on a device use: ldd on the binary, or package manager queries (apt/rpm/opkg) to get package info and version.

- Open-source status / where to find source
  - libvconf (vconf) is part of the Tizen platform and its source is published in Tizen’s public repositories (Tizen Project / git.tizen.org) and Samsung’s open-source releases. So yes — the upstream vconf sources are available as open source.
  - Note: vendor/device-specific versions, additional keys, or proprietary modules that interact with vconf may not be open source.

If you want, I can:
- Show a minimal C example that reads a key and registers a change callback.
- Help locate the exact source package or git repo for the version used by your binary if you can share the device/platform info or the libvconf SONAME/version from ldd.
