# Restoring the vacuum (r2con2025)

2025-10-25

> We took apart an EOL’d vacuum cleaner and reverse engineered it from hardware
> to firmware, building our own custom system to gain full control over the main
> compute board. This talk walks through the entire process — from capturing
> hardware traces and identifying peripherals to using AI tools to analyze an
> ARM32 firmware and recover working source code. Expect practical insights 
> where electronics, reverse engineering, and LLMs come together to bring 
> “old” devices back to life.
