> Windows process emulation was already possible with mwemu, and in most of cases
> was very effective for emulating small group of functions, decrypting stuff,
> etc. However full-emulation of the malware was something like an utopia.

> Latest improvements by mwemu team alow the reverser do analysis with
> radare2 from inside the emulated process. This is useful for inspecting
> memory data chunks, but also code analysis, functions recognizement,
> decompilers, ai, or any of the zillions of radare2 features.
