> Accessing buffers is always tricky—especially when mmap comes into play. This
> talk dives into a subtle bug in radare2 that uncovered a series of
> non-portable syscalls and broader portability issues. Along the way, we’ll
> explore how operating systems manage memory and how these details can lead to
> vulnerabilities in modern software. If you’re curious about low-level memory
> handling and hidden pitfalls, this is a session you won’t want to miss.
